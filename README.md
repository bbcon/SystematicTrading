# SystematicTrading

This repositiory is a work in progress and documents the development of a systematic trading framework inspired by the book "Systematic Trading" by Robert Carver. The idea is to create a R-package which makes it easy to back-test (using boostrapping techniques) and evaluate the (after cost) performance of a wide variety of systematic trading rules. More details will come when the project is at a more advanced stage.
